# LUT-Optimization
Optimization of Look-Up Tables (LUTs) : LUTs are essentially small memory elements that store precomputed values to accelerate calculations or implement complex functions efficiently.
Optimization of Look-Up Tables for memory-based computation is an important aspect of digital system design, especially in fields such as digital signal processing, image processing, and FPGA-based designs.
